        <p> Gitkraken is a software that is essentually a middleman between the software you're using to make the webdite and Git Hub. Hopefully you hsould know about guthub by now but just incase you havn't in short github is a repository for all of the work you do, everytime you make a small or big change you can back up all your data to the repository it's basically a cloud for programming. So with that, Gitkraken is a really handy program that lets you see your repository and all the changes that you or anyone else makes </p>
